# Weather-API
## Basic weather app using Python.

## Project discription - It's a graphical weather app with a user-friendly interface (GUI) using libraries like Tkinter or PyQt. Enable users to input their location or use GPS for automatic detection. Provide detailed weather data, including current conditions, hourly forecasts, wind speed, and visual elements like weather icons.

 ## Key Concepts:
 # API Integration: Connect to a weather API and parse JSON data.
 # User Input Handling: Validate and process user input for location.
 # GUI Design: Create a user-friendly interface with input fields, weather data displays, and visual elements.
 # Error Handling: Address potential errors during data retrieval or user input.
 # Data Visualization: Display weather data in an appealing manner, possibly using icons or animations.
 # Unit Conversion: Offer unit options for temperature (e.g., Celsius and Fahrenheit).
